Some of SQL Queries used for solving KPI's

1. KPI's 7(Weekday  & Weekend  Revenue and Booking)
SELECT dd.day_type AS Day_Type,COUNT(fb.booking_id) AS Booking,
CONCAT(FORMAT(SUM(fb.revenue_realized)/1000000, 0), ' M') AS Total_Revenue
FROM fact_bookings fb
JOIN dim_date dd
ON  dd.converted_date = fb.date_column
GROUP BY dd.day_type;

2. KPI's 8(Revenue by City & hotel)
SELECT dh.city As City,dh.property_name AS Hotel,
CONCAT(FORMAT(SUM(fb.revenue_realized)/1000000, 0), ' M') AS Revenue
FROM dim_hotels  dh
JOIN fact_bookings fb
ON dh.property_id = fb.property_id
GROUP BY 
dh.city,
dh.property_name;

3. KPIs 11(Weekly trend Key trend (Revenue, Total booking, Occupancy)
SELECT dd.`week no` AS Week_No,
COUNT(fb.booking_id) AS Booking,
SUM( CASE 
WHEN fb.booking_status = "Checked Out" THEN  1 ELSE 0 END) AS Utilized_Capacity,
CONCAT(FORMAT(SUM(fb.revenue_realized) / 1000000, 0), ' M') AS Revenue
FROM 
dim_date dd
JOIN fact_bookings fb
ON dd.converted_date = fb.date_column
GROUP BY dd.`week no`;

5. KPI's 3(Cancellation Rate)
 SELECT  dr.room_class AS Room_Class,
  CONCAT(FORMAT((SUM(CASE 
   WHEN fb.booking_status = 'Cancelled' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(fb.booking_id)) * 100, 2), '%') AS Cancellation_Rate
FROM 
dim_rooms dr
JOIN 
fact_bookings fb ON dr.room_id = fb.room_category
GROUP BY dr.room_class;
